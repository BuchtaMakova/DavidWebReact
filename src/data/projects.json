The app is used to guide tourists around the town and to teach them about important places and their history. The app features an interactive map which contains of places of interest and historical photos. Places of interest are the most known and interesting places in Pribor which might interest the tourist. The historical photos on the other hand are placed on the map by the users themselves. The photos must be placed on the map at the exact location where they were taken so it has a lovely effect of seeing how the town looked like in the past compared to how it looks like now.",
